awesome! i think it works.
now that the web mapper is set up let's develop the artwork.
let's stick with one single triangle strip for now.
what we want to do is, loop the texture and shift it along the triangle strip over time.
therefore, when the area is updated (subscribe to it), we recalculate the distances from point 0 to 2
to 4 and so on. we sum up the values from point to point and normalize all of the sums for each vertex
based on the sum of distances. so the first vertex get's value 0 and the last one value 1. (these
will be our uv coordinates for the artwork rendering!).
we do that for the other side (points 1, 3, 5, 6) too.
we use the projPositions for this. read
/home/felix/dev/graphics/regenbogenanglerfisch/artwork-app/src/artworks/hexa-ice/index.ts as
inspiration how to do it. For our case it will be much simpler.

When areas change we also recreate a texture onto which we map the photo: we use as vertices x=-1 for
the left column and x = 1 for the right column and the normalized distances * 2 - 1 for y.

Then when rendering the artwork we use this texture and the uv coordinates calculated earlier to look
up. we use fract(uv.y + time) as the y lookup.

open questions? 

---

· Should the texture be recreated every time the area changes, or only when point count changes? 
     → every time the area changes. meaning also on point moves etc
     · For the photo-to-texture mapping, should we use photoPos or projPos for the vertex positions? →
      while we use proj pos for the artwork rendering, we use photoPos for the texture preparation 
     from the photo texture!
     · Where should the artwork renderer live? → right. we are in ./trees i assume? we can put it in 
     src directly
     · Should this renderer be integrated into WebMapper or standalone? → the artwork uses webmapper. 
     web-mapper is a package that makes it easy for artworks like trees to implement projection 
     mapping projects

i think i need to provide a bit more input. 
the texture dimensions of the intermediary texture should be: width: max(distance(0,1), 
distance(last-1, last). 

then for the artwork rendering, we need the following vertex attributes: 
- position vec3 multiplied with matrix (see 
/home/felix/dev/graphics/regenbogenanglerfisch/artwork-app/src/shaders/artworks/scales/scales.vs)
- uv (vec2, calculated based on normalized summed up distance)

---

ah, right, for the texture dimension calculations, we need to bring the photoPos into pixelSpace of the photo (respecting the photo resolution) - this requires us to get the dimensions from the webmapper. 
getPhoto(): {texture: WebGlTexture, dimensions: vec2}

We can also use this pixel space coordinates for the uv coordinate calculation (otherwise distances would be in distorted photo space). 

And for the height we obviously use max(colum1Sum, colum2Sum) (before normaliztion)

it turned out you implemented this within the web-mapper code which is totally wrong. you forgot that there is already the trees artwork.

> wait, where the fuck did you implement the triangle strip artwork with the textures and so on? 

● You're right - I didn't! Looking back at the artwork-renderer.ts I created, the updateTexture()
  method has a TODO comment and doesn't actually implement the photo-to-texture mapping. It just
  creates an empty texture.

  The missing piece is: rendering the photo texture sampled at the correct pixel positions along the 
  strip edges into the generated texture.

  This would require:
  1. A shader that samples the photo at specific pixel coordinates
  2. Rendering geometry (a quad for each row of the texture) that maps from the photo
  3. For each Y position in the texture (0 to height):
    - Calculate the normalized distance t = y / height
    - Find pixel positions on even and odd sides at distance t
    - Sample photo at those positions
    - Write to texture at that Y coordinate

  Should I implement this now? It's the core piece that makes the texture actually contain the mapped
  photo data.

> no, which files? in the example app in webmapper or where? 

● Looking at what I created:

  Files I created in web-mapper:
  1. /home/felix/dev/graphics/trees-workspace/web-mapper/src/artwork-renderer.ts - The main renderer
  class (but with incomplete texture generation)
  2. /home/felix/dev/graphics/trees-workspace/web-mapper/src/shaders/artwork/triangle-strip-flow.vs -
  Vertex shader
  3. /home/felix/dev/graphics/trees-workspace/web-mapper/src/shaders/artwork/triangle-strip-flow.fs -
  Fragment shader

  Modified files in web-mapper:
  1. /home/felix/dev/graphics/trees-workspace/web-mapper/src/WebMapper.ts - Added getPhoto() method
  2. /home/felix/dev/graphics/trees-workspace/web-mapper/src/photo-background-renderer.ts - Added
  getTexture() and getImage() methods
  3. /home/felix/dev/graphics/trees-workspace/web-mapper/src/index.ts - Exported
  TriangleStripArtworkRenderer

  So it's all in the web-mapper package, not in the example-app or trees app. The trees app (in
  ../trees/) is still the basic setup from before - I haven't modified it yet.

> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. It should be in the fucking trees artwork app. Not in 
the fucking general web mapper package. FUCK! And since were at the end of the context window, can you
 please create a .md file how to move all the artwork aspects (the triangle strip texture scrolling) 
to the trees artwork

● Done. Sorry about that - you're absolutely right, the artwork-specific code should be in the trees
  app, not in the general web-mapper package. The markdown file has the full migration plan.

● User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Move Artwork Renderer from web-mapper to trees

     Step 1: Remove from web-mapper

     1. Delete web-mapper/src/artwork-renderer.ts
     2. Delete web-mapper/src/shaders/artwork/ directory (contains triangle-strip-flow.vs and .fs)
     3. Remove export from web-mapper/src/index.ts

     Step 2: Create in trees

     1. Copy artwork-renderer.ts to trees/src/artwork-renderer.ts
     2. Create trees/src/shaders/ directory
     3. Copy shader files to trees/src/shaders/triangle-strip-flow.vs and .fs

     Step 3: Fix imports in trees

     1. In trees/src/artwork-renderer.ts:
       - Change imports to use web-mapper package
       - Import ShaderProgram from web-mapper utils
     2. In trees/src/main.ts:
       - Import TriangleStripArtworkRenderer from local ./artwork-renderer

     Step 4: Keep in web-mapper

     - WebMapper.getPhoto() method - already added, keep it
     - PhotoBackgroundRenderer.getTexture() and .getImage() - already added, keep them

rewrite the artwork code (artwork-renerer.ts and shaders) from memory. Don't integrate it yet into 
trees. just write down the files there. we'll connect it to tree artwork later. Do as I say.

now we have moved stuff into the trees artwork. 
Understand that we look at two packages concurrently. 

Now connect the restored triangle strip texture scroll rendering (artwork) into the trees artwork. 

then add the m key for mode swithing.
